# MailTimeBottlecap_ASL
An automated splitter script for LiveSplit for use on the Mail Time Demo (for Bottlecap% only)

V1.0 is up right now.

For now it is only possible to use on Windows 64-bit (32-bit untested, idk how the data types will behave, at one point I hade ulong in there)
If it doesn't work and you're on windows, it is because the base address for the needed memory pointers is diff on your computer. Ping or DM @ProCon#3108 on the Mail Time Discord.

Back the Kickstarter https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freedomgamesgg/mail-time !

The script will auto reset when you go back to the home screen. Wait fifteen seconds after launching the ASL before trying to quick start. Right it will
only register a split IF YOU FULLY GET THE BOTTLECAP INTO YOUR INVENTORY. I'm working on logging splits when you have it trailing you, but it's not easy to find
that information in memory. It will autostart as you as you finishing the intro dialogue so be ready. It will stop the time as soon as all 6 caps are registered into your inventory.
